Displays a moving trail of historical positions for selected aircraft.
At each update, one Placemark is added to the head of the trail. If more Placemarks are displayed than the maximum trail length, excess Placemarks are removed from the tail of the trail.
The trail length can be set in the UI. The same trail length is applied to all aircraft.
