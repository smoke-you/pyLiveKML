# Purpose

This example app is intended to demonstrate:
* Subclassing KML Placemarks, including:
    * Translating a simple 2D shape projected onto the xy-plane to a geospatial object (polygon) located at specific LLA coordinates
* Dynamically reconfiguring KML Placemarks, e.g. by:
    * Moving
    * Rotating
    * Re-colouring

Note that rotation and movement is shown to work for more complex shapes that have inner boundaries or cutouts.
