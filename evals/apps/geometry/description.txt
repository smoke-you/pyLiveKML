Displays two polygons, a ring and an ellipse.
The ring is clamped to ground and its altitude is fixed, whereas the ellipse is floating and its altitude can be changed.
Both polygons can be individually moved to new coordinates (LL/LLA), and have the colours (ARGB) of their border and fill changed.
Both polgons can be individually rotated around their local z-axis, although this has no effect on the ring as it is symmetrical.
