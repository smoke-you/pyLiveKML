class Overlay(Feature, ABC):
    """A KML 'Overlay' tag constructor.

    This is an abstract element and cannot be used directly in a KML file. `Overlay` is
    the base type for image overlays drawn on the planet surface or on the screen.
    `icon` specifies the image to use and can be configured to reload images based on a
    timer or by camera changes. This class also includes specifications for stacking
    order of multiple overlays and for adding color and transparency values to the base
    image.

    Parameters
    ----------
    icon : str | Icon | None, default = None
        Defines the location of the image to be used as the `Overlay`. This location can
        be either on a local file system or on a web server. If this attribute is `None`,
        a rectangle is drawn using the color and size defined by the ground or screen
        overlay. If a simple `str` is supplied, then it will be used as the `href` of an
        `Icon`.
    color : GeoColor | int | None, default = None
        The image or rectangle color and transparency.
    draw_order : int | None, default = None
        Defines the stacking order for the images in overlapping `Overlay`s. `Overlay`s
        with higher `draw_order` values are drawn on top of `Overlay`s with lower
        `draw_order` values.
    name : str|None, default = None
        User-defined text displayed in the 3D viewer as the label for the object.
    visibility : bool | None, default = None
        Specifies whether the `Feature` is drawn in the 3D viewer when it is initially
        loaded. In order for a `Feature` to be visible, the `<visibility>` tag of all
        its ancestors must also be set `True`.
    is_open : bool | None, default = None
        Specifies whether a `Document` or `Folder` appears closed or open when first
        loaded into the "Places" panel. `False` or `None` is collapsed (the default),
        `True` is expanded. This element applies only to `Document`, `Folder`, and
        `NetworkLink`.
    author_name : str | None, default = None
        The name of the author of the `Feature`.
    author_link : str | None, default = None
        URL of the web page containing the KML file.
    address : str | None, default = None
        A string value representing an unstructured address written as a standard street,
        city, state address, and/or as a postal code.
    phone_number : str | None, default = None
        A string value representing a telephone number. This element is used by Google
        Maps Mobile only. The industry standard for Java-enabled cellular phones is
        RFC2806.
    snippet : str | None, default = None
        A short description of the `Feature`. In Google Earth, this description is
        displayed in the "Places" panel under the name of the `Feature`. If a `<Snippet>`
        is not supplied, the first two lines of the `<description>` are used. In Google
        Earth, if a `Placemark` contains both a `<description>` and a `<Snippet>`, the
        `<Snippet>` appears beneath the `Placemark` in the "Places" panel, and the
        `<description>` appears in the `Placemark`'s description balloon. This tag does
        not support HTML markup.
    snippet_max_lines : int | None, default = None
    description : str | None, default = None
        User-supplied content that appears in the description balloon. HTML *is*
        supported, but it is **highly** recommended to read the detailed documentation
        at
        https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference#elements-specific-to-feature
    abstract_view : AbstractView | None, default = None
        Any concrete subclass of :class:`pyLiveKML.objects.AbstractView`, i.e. either a
        :class:`pyLiveKML.objects.Camera` or :class:`pyLiveKML.objects.LookAt`
    time_primitive : TimePrimitive | None, default = None
        Any concrete subclass of :class:`pyLiveKML.objects.TimePrimitive`, i.e. either a
        :class:`pyLiveKML.objects.TimeStamp` or :class:`pyLiveKML.objects.TimeSpan`
    style_url : str | None = None
        URL of a `<Style>` or `<StyleMap>` defined in a `<Document>`. If the style is in
        the same file, use a # reference. If the style is defined in an external file,
        use a full URL along with # referencing.
    styles : StyleSelector | Iterable[StyleSelector] | None, default = None
        One or more `Style`s and `StyleMap`s can be defined to customize the appearance
        of any element derived from `Feature` or of the `Geometry` in a `Placemark`. A
        style defined within a `Feature` is called an "inline style" and applies only to
        the `Feature` that contains it. A style defined as the child of a `<Document>` is
        called a "shared style." A shared style must have an id defined for it. This id
        is referenced by one or more `Features` within the `<Document>`. In cases where
        a style element is defined both in a shared style and in an inline style for a
        `Feature` — that is, a `Folder`, `GroundOverlay`, `NetworkLink`, `Placemark`, or
        `ScreenOverlay` — the value for the `Feature`'s inline style takes precedence over
        the value for the shared style.
    region : Region | None, default = None
        `Feature`s and `Geometry`'s associated with a `Region` are drawn only when the
        `Region` is active.
    extended_data : ExtendedData | None, default = None
        Allows you to add custom data to a KML file. This data can be:
        * Data that references an external XML schema.
        * Untyped data/value pairs.
        * Typed data.

        A given KML `Feature` can contain a combination of these types of custom data.
